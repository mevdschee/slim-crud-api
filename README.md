# slim-crud-api

This project has the minimal implementation for an "Automatic REST API for SlimPHP 4" as described in this post

https://tqdev.com/2019-automatic-rest-api-slimphp-4-minimal

Run it using:

    php -S localhost:8080

And visit the URL:

    http://localhost:8080/api/records/posts

Replace "posts" with the name of any table in your database. If everything works as expected, then you should see the contents of the table in JSON format.
